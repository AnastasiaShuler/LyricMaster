I. ABOUT
    At this point you might be asking yourself: "What the heck is this thing?"
    Well, LyricMaster is a pet project I started in the Summer of 2014 as a way
    to learn more about the Python language. 

    Inspiration struck one day as I was trying to determine what song was stuck
    in my head. I knew the lyrics, even the artist, but not which one of the 
    many songs in my library I was stuck on. LyricMaster provides the user the 
    ability to search the lyrics to their music for key words and phrases, or
    simply look up the lyrics in general
    
    I realize that there are Internet-based versions of this same thing, but
    those require access to the Internet. Additionally, LyricMaster will narrow 
    the serach to only songs that exist in the user's library. This can be 
    particularly useful if the lyrics in question are common to a multitude of
    tracks.

    I hope you find LyricMaster helpful, or simply amusing.
    Happy Mastering!

II. USAGE

III. LYRICFILES
    LyricMaster stores all lyrics to your music library in a simple text file.
    While this is perhaps not the most ergonimic data structure for serch 
    purposes, it does allow the user the ability to add, modify, or simply view
    the lyrics s/he has collected in that file.

    Each LyricFile is structured in the same way. The default file name as given
    by the LyricMaster program is of the form: LyricMaster_LyricFile_dd-mm-YYYY.
    The filename can also be specified by the user.
